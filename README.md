# House Price Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook analyzes a dataset of house prices in Delhi, India, with the goal of building a predictive model. The dataset contains 4,998 property listings with 40 features including price, area, number of bedrooms, location, and various amenities.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Initial examination of the dataset structure and basic statistics
- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of the 'Location' column and handling of missing values
- **Visualization**: Histograms of all features to understand distributions
- **Feature Engineering**: Potential transformations of variables for modeling

## Dataset Characteristics
- 4,998 property listings
- 39 features after removing 'Location'
- Mix of numerical (price, area) and binary (amenities) features
- Price range from 2,000,000 to 854,600,000 INR
- Area range from 200 to 16,000 sq ft
- Bedrooms range from 1 to 8

## Next Steps
The notebook appears to be in early stages of analysis. Potential next steps would include:
- More detailed exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Handling of outliers (particularly in price and area)
- Model building and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis

## Usage
The notebook demonstrates fundamental data analysis techniques that could be applied to similar real estate datasets. The visualizations and statistical summaries provide a solid foundation for building predictive models.

Note: The notebook appears incomplete as many code cells show "execution_count": null, suggesting additional analysis was planned but not yet implemented.
